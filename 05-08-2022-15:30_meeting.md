## Meeting #01
### Date/Time/Location: 05-08-2021/15:30/QUT-GP-Campus-S11
### Participants: Harrop, M.; Browne, W.; Crawford, R.; Wood, R.; Williamson, T.

#### Meeting Main Topics of Importance

Reporting Project Progress For Milestones & Assessment:
> Find method to record meeting minutes and make available to all interested parties.

> Catalog all revelent literature/findings and make available to all interested parties.

> Catalog all project writings and make available to all interested parties.

> Industry-lead honours paperwork. 

Tasks For Project Progession:
> Conduct literature review on all possible/viable methods for cartilage resection from bone. 
> Collect all relevent literature findings and make accessible to all interested parties.

> Keep up with other expected coursework.

Recent Relevant Findings:
> Possible methods for selective cartilage ablation/removal include: rotating burr harder than
> cartilage yet softer than bone, high-power laser that preferentially targets charged organic molecules
> within cartilage (e.g., water, collagen, etc.), low-frequency ultrasound that selectively vibrates
> cartilage cells (requires knowledge of cell vibration models). Must continue literature review
> to decide the direction of the project (deadline week 7).

Expected Outcomes Until Next Meeting:
> Continuing literature review to gain deeper understanding of project approach methods. This
> will used later to determine project goals and deliverables.

> Meeting with Cameron to discuss use of high-power lasers for ablation purposes (next meeting).

> Record all necessary project documentation and make accessible to all relevant parties.

> Industry-lead honours paperwork progression. 

Conculsions:
> At this time project is on track for completion, no alternate or external actions required.
